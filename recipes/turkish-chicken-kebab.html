<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  This chicken kebab recipe uses a flavorful, yogurt-based marinade. I'd like to think that all the chicken coming off
  American grills this summer will be as tasty, juicy, and tender as these. Even inexperienced grillers can produce
  impressive results! I'm not sure how "Turkish" this is — it's loosely based on a lamb marinade I've used for a long
  time.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
Here's the list of ingredients formatted as an unordered list in HTML: ```html
<ul>
  <li>1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt</li>
  <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
  <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>2 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved</li>
  <li>4 long metal skewers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whisk yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, ketchup, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and
    cinnamon together in a large bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover the bowl with
    plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 8 hours.
  </li>
  <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
  <li>
    Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers, making a fairly thick
    "log" shape.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place kebabs on the preheated grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4
    minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking and turning until the chicken is
    no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read
    at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
  </li>
</ul>
